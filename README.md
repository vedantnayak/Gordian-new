## Project Description

I have created a Office Catering Count site. 
Every employee can login and submit their lunch order so that the caterer gets a gist of what the order will look like and there's no wastage of food.
Admin id- admin 
password- a
Employee1 id- 1234
Employee pw- @
Employee2 id- 2345
Employee pw- @@
...
Admin can reset orders post lunch for next meal/day.
On hitting total he gets total count of each dish.

Further improvements can be made.
